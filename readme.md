# About Project

Developed a cross-platform native mobile application using React-native for the detection of plants diseases and identification of the flower species by preparing a bridge between the front-end side of the application and the server-side, where all the CNN models will run, using Google’s Firebase and Firestore.

# Work Model

1) Phase 1: Building an App using react-native to input the image data from the user.
2) Phase 2: Store the data in the Google’s database – Firestore.
3) Phase 3: Building a python server that downloads the image and feeds it into the CNN to predict the result.

# Conclusion

In this project, an automated system is developed with react-native that predicts the diseases in plants. The algorithm is validated for 46 diseases in 16 plant species Apple, Banana, Blueberry, Capsicum, Cherry, Corn, Grapes, Oranges, Peach, Potato, Raspberry, Rice, Soybean, Squash, Strawberry, Tomato. While the reported results are very encouraging. The flower detection works on “5 category flower dataset ” total of 4242 images of 5 flowers which includes daisy, roses, tulip, sunflower and dandelion. The algorithm has been deployed on a real smartphone application.
